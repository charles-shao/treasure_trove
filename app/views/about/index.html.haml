      We enrich Trove data, with OpenCalais. A service that provides metadata generation.
    %br
    %p
      It provides us with entities such as locations, people or organisations within the Trove data which enhances the contextual information available.
    %p
      For location data, we've included Google Maps, plotting locations OpenCalais provides a more wider, possibly global scope to the stories told by TreasureTrove.
    %p
      For richer context data, weâ€™ve included DBPedia integration which allows the union of rich wiki styled data crossed with the basis provided by Trove.
      TreasureTrove is developed in Ruby On Rails, leveraging OpenCalais, Google Maps and dbpedia with the potential to integrate many more.
